                        OREC gives students the opportunity to enjoy the sport of rock climbing outdoors, which few often do. There are two forms of rock climbing that OREC brings students outdoors: bouldering and top rope.

                        around the state and the harder challenge of spending multiple days outdoors backpacking along the trail.
