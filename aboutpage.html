                <h3>An Overview</h3>
                    <article>
                        OREC is an organization that is run primarily of students who come together in their shared passion and appreciation of the outdoors. In their shared appreciation, these students, along with other members of the university staff, coordinate and plan activities in nature for other students to enjoy. These activities can be either easy and care free ones or challenging ones that give the participants achievement.

                <h3>Experiential Education</h3>
                    <article>
                        Through unique and challenging experiences, OREC hopes that the student participants grow in self-confidence and have a better understanding of themselves. To accomplish this, OREC engages the students in what is called experiential education where students gain essential skills for traveling in nature and gain a better understanding of their abilities, namely having more capable abilities.
